# PoC
My PoC. 
This is a demo of WannaB. 
WannaB  was originally designed to provide hotel guests with a simple and easy access platform in which they can manage their hotel room reservation and order food from the hotel. 

This update adds features like restaurant reservations, movie tickets purchasing and takeout ordering to this application. It allows users to get easy access to a wild rang of entertainment options. It also enables users to get more access to booking discounts, including family plans, coupons, group purchase information, etc. makes it more convenient for the user to choose the most suitable item for them at the best price.  

My responsibility in this project including designing and developing Microservices based application for account management, payment management, and reservation status management. I developed this application using spring could and Netflix Eureka. And Build each function as an independent module using java 8 and spring boot 2 framework for it convince to add configuration.
This application also allows administrators to perform change to the reservation, manage coupons availability, activate, or disable user accounts.

Users can create account and login by creating login tokens, or by getting the API keys from exiting accounts like google, GitHub, and Facebook, by implementing OAuth2, users can login in without the need to create a new account. It provides a credential that can be used to login to multiple modules with one pair of username and password, it controls the access of the resource and protect the information of users.
